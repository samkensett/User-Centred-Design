# User-Centred-Design
This repository provides examples of the User-Centred Design project I have undertaken. 

The Social Ease prototype document showcases the prototyping process from establishing user requirements, through to prototype iteration and evaluation, with reference to industry standards throughout.

The Spotify UI Evaluation is a critique of the Spotify application for iOS including the ways in which the UI was designed effectively and the ways in which it could be improved. Recommendations are provided based on Nielsen's heuristics and other industry standards.
